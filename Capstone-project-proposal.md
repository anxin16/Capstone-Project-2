## I. Introduction
From previous research, higher incomes are associated with longer life expectancy. How can we reduce socioeconomic disparities in health outcomes? Although it is well known that there are significant differences in health and longevity between income groups, debate remains about the magnitudes and determinants of these differences.     

We use new data from 1.4 billion anonymous earnings and mortality records to construct more precise estimates of the relationship between income and life expectancy at the national level. We then construct new local area (county and metro area) estimates of life expectancy by income group and identify factors that are associated with higher levels of life expectancy for low-income individuals.      
#### In this study, I want to solve following problems:  
1. What is the shape of the incomeâ€“life expectancy gradient?
2. How are gaps in life expectancy changing over time?
3. How do the gaps vary across local areas?
4. What are the factors associated with the longevity gap? 

## II. Purpose
Addressing socioeconomic disparities in health is a major policy goal. Yet the magnitude of socioeconomic gaps in life expectancy, how these gaps are changing over time, and their determinants are not clear. In this project, newly available data covering the US population will be used to obtain more comprehensive and precise estimates of the relationship between income and life expectancy at the national level. Local area estimates of life expectancy by income will be calculated and factors that are correlated with higher life expectancy for individuals with low incomes will be identified.  

The purpose of this project is to characterize life expectancy by income, over time, and across areas. We will use de-identified data from tax records covering the US population from 1999-2014 to characterize income-mortality gradients. We will also characterize correlates of the spatial variation and construct publicly available statistics. We will build a model to predict the life expectancy of individuals by their age, income, living area and other aspects.   

The analysis try to provide information for government agencies and  health care companies to improve their services and environmental factors as well as help individuals to change their behaviors to get long life expectancy.

## III. Data-Source
The This project use datasets from the Health Inequality Project.  
Website: https://healthinequality.org/data/  
The datasets provide 14 formatted data tables in Excel format, along with documentation for each table. These tables contain life expectancy estimates by income and sex at various levels of geographic and temporal aggregation. I downloaded the data in Excel files.

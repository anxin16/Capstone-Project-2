## I. Introduction
In 2015, more than 400,000 employees participated in the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS). The survey includes questions about satisfaction, leadership, and work schedules. The analysis try to identify the working status and give result on in which respect and how to improve the feelings of federal employees. From the analysis of the survey, we can get answers to many interesting questions.  

Employee feedback on key performance metrics captured in the FEVS is singularly important for each agency to realize its mission, as well as maintain and enhance Federal workforce. The feedback enables each agency to develop effective strategies and tools for driving continuous improvement.     
#### In this study, I want to solve following problems:  
1. How to measure satisfaction and engagement of employees with answers of survey?  
2. What are the relationships of satisfaction/engagement via different groups (gender, age, years of service, supervisor status, agency etc.)?   
3. What factors affect satisfaction of employees?  
4. What factors affect engagement of employees?  
5. How to drive engagement of employees?   

## II. Purpose
Each year leaders in the Federal Government use the Federal Employee Viewpoint Survey (FEVS) as a management tool to drive change and increase employee engagement in the federal workforce. The use of that data continues to translate into better service for the American people.  

The purpose of this project is to analyze the data of FEVS and identify the working status and give results on in which respect and how to improve the feelings of federal employees, measure employees' perceptions of whether, and to what extent, conditions characterizing successful organizations are present in their agencies.   

The analysis try to provide information for agency leaders and managers seek to improve their human capital management. Every agency has its own unique mission and workforce, and its own set of special human capital challenges. Guided by the analysis results, agency leaders can take steps to improve how employees engage with their jobs, organizations, and missions.

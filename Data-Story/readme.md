# Data Story
In this research, we worked on the distrabusion and relationship of mean household income and life expectancy of males vs females in year 2001 to 2014. We can draw following conclusions from our research:

1. Mean household income of Americans are not equal. 1% people have 20 times more income than that of other 99% people. Nearly 1% people are very poor. They have 100 times less income than people in the average level.
2. Males have higher income than females, but their life expectancies are lower than females. Life expectancy difference of males and females in the lowest 5 percentiles are higher than people in the highest 20 percentiles.
3. People with higher household income have higher life expectancy. From 2001 to 2014, though the mean household income of people are slighly decreased, life expectancy increased, especially for the rich people.
4. For the people whose household income are in the lowest 5 percentile, their life expectancies are much lower than other people. For people whose mean household income are below 100,100USD, their life expectancy difference are bigger by different income. But for people whose mean household income are over 200,000USD, their life expectancy difference are not distinct by different income.

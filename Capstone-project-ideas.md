## Health and wealth analysis
This analysis will use datasets from the Health Inequality Project (https://healthinequality.org/data/). The datasets provide data at the national, state, county, and “commuting zone” levels. The analysis will calculate American life expectancies by income, gender, and geography. From the analysis result, people can figure out how long they will live and where to live the longest.

## Food surveillance report
Late last year, the FDA began publishing a dataset of "adverse events" that have been reported to its Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (https://www.fda.gov/Food/ComplianceEnforcement/ucm494015.htm). The database currently covers January 2004 through December 2016, and includes reports of (suspected) bad reactions to foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics. By analyze the data, we can get the quality of different food and predict rate of safety and nutrition for each kind of food.

## Medicare drug costs comparison	
This project will use data released by The federal government on Medicare’s prescription drug spending from 2011 to 2015 (https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Information-on-Prescription-Drugs/2015MedicareData.html). The release includes data on all drugs used by at least 11 Medicare patients in a given year. By compare the Medicare drug costs of each year, we can find the trend of the drug usage and predict the costs in future years.

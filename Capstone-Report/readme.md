## I. Introduction
Addressing socioeconomic disparities in health is a major policy goal. Yet what is the magnitude of socioeconomic gaps in life expectancy? How these gaps are changing over time? And what are their determinants? Answers to these questions are not clear. 

In this project, we use new data from 1.4 billion anonymous earnings and mortality records to construct more precise estimates of the relationship between income and life expectancy at the national level. We then construct new local area (county and metro area) estimates of life expectancy by income group and identify factors that are associated with higher levels of life expectancy for low-income individuals. 

The purpose of this project is to characterize life expectancy by income, over time, and across areas. We will use de-identified data from tax records covering the US population from 2001-2014 to characterize income-mortality gradients. We will also characterize correlates of the spatial variation and construct publicly available statistics. We will build a model to predict the life expectancy of individuals by their age, income, living area and other aspects.

The analysis try to provide information for government agencies and  health care companies to improve their services and environmental factors as well as help individuals to change their behaviors to get long life expectancy.
#### In this study, I want to solve following problems:  
1. What is the shape of the incomeâ€“life expectancy gradient?
2. How are gaps in life expectancy changing over time?
3. How do the gaps vary across local areas?
4. What are the factors associated with differences in life expectancy?
